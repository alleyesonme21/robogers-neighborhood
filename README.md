#### _This app is a weekly programming submission for Epicodus programming bootcamp. The learning objectives are to separate Javascript business logic and user interface logic, implement for loops and include tests for each behavior. 8/21/20_

#### By _**Johnny Duverseau**_

## Description

_This application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number. If a user enters number 1 the website returns with "Beep", number 2 returns "Boop", and 3 returns "Won't you be my neighbor?"_

### Specs
_The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user’s inputted number._
  * Input: “4”
  * Output: “0, 1, 2, 3, 4”

_The program will replace numbers with strings (phrases) based on the rules:_

_If a user inputs a number and the range from 0 to that number1 includes 1, the program returns a range that replaces the 1 with “Beep!”_
* Input: “1”
* Output: “0, Beep”

_Then, if a user inputs a number and the range from 0 to that number includes 2, the program will also return a range that replaces the 2 with “Boop!”_
* Input: “2”
* Output: “0, Beep, Boop”

_Then, if a user inputs a number and the range from 0 to that number includes 3, the program will also return a range that replaces the 3 with “Won’t you be my neighbor?”_
* Input: “5”
* Output: “0, Beep, Boop, Won’t you be my neighbor?, 4, 5”


_However, there are exceptions to the rules._
_The program will return the phrase “Won’t you be my neighbor?” if a user inputs the number “13” and will return the phrase “Boop!” if a user inputs the number 21._


_However, if a user enters a number that contains both a 3 and a 1, this rule for 3 takes precedence and the entire number is replaced with “Won’t you be my neighbor?”_
* Input: “31”
* Output: "Won't you be my neighbor"?
